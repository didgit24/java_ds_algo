// #1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance. Insertion sort as small size.

// #2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount. Radix sort or counting sort. As integers range is small.

// #3 - Sport scores on ESPN. Quick sort as space complexity is less.

// #4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data. Merge sort as tons of data, and space complexity nod needed.

// #5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews. Insertion sort as it is almost sorted.

// #6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada. First radix or counting sort if no decimal places. Otherwise Quick Sort for space complexity.

// #7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Merge sort if enough memory otherwise Quick sort.

// #8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time. Bubble and Selection sort.

### Searching

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS


//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS, as a tree is really deep tree and it will take recursion to repeat the node.


//If the tree is very wide: DFS, as BFS will take too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS


//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS


//Finding the shortest path: BFS
